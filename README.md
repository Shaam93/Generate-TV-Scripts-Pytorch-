# Generate-TV-Scripts-Pytorch-
In this project, we use RNNs to generate our own Seinfeld TV scripts. We use part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons (available in './data/Seinfeld_Scripts.txt') and our neural network will generate new "fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.


**How to run**
1. Clone the project: [https://github.com/Shosho93/Generate-TV-Scripts-Pytorch-.git]
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project folder.
3. Open the notebook "dlnd_tv_script_generation" in your Jupyter Notebook to be able to edit by using the command line: `jupyter notebook dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb`
4. The other python scripts are there to provide some tests along the project (you do not need to modify it)


**Results**

The results are not necessarily grammatically correct, and does not make sense in general but they show sometimes the right sequence of common-used sentences.
