# Generate-TV-Scripts-Pytorch-
In this project, we use RNNs to generate our own Seinfeld TV scripts. We use part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons (available in './data/Seinfeld_Scripts.txt') and our neural network will generate new "fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
